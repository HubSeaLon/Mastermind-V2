# Mastermind

In my second year of computer science, I made a Mastermind game with nic0119 on Lazarus (Pascal). 

Mastermind is is a code-breaking game for 2 player, an encoder and decoder. There are many variants of the game. 

In our conception, the encoder has to create a code by placing 4 colors with 6 different colors possible. He can use the same color as many times he wants. At each decoder's attempt, he indicates the number of good color, and the number of good coolor and well placed. 

Then, the decoder has 10 chances to find the code. 

## Exemple 

Code :     blue blue white yellow
Attempt :  blue black purple blue
Indication will be 2 good colors because of 2 blue in the code and 2 blue in attempt. And 1 good color and well placed because of the first blue. 

By downloading the .exe, you will play in local against a bot that we made as an encoder and decoder.

Have fun !
